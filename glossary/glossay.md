##ArcPy
ArcPy is a set of tools and arguments used by ESRI in order to execute geoprocessing functions.
It is appendable to a classic Python script, and can be used inside and outside of ArcMap.
To access it outside of ESRI products, use the code 'import arcpy'.
It is used, in many cases, to automate iterative analysis

##Function

##Geoprocessing
Geoprocessing is a large variety of operations that uses input data to generate meaningful output data in ArcGIS (or other GIS softwares).
It deals with spatial data, with a geographic coordinate system.
An example is the use of the raster calculator/map algebra tool to generate a suitability model. For instance, to find ideal park sites, the following forumla can be used:
Population Density > x * Distance to Parks < y = Ideal Park Sites

##Try/Except
Try/Except is a way to handle possible errors which the program or interface might experience. 
It will try the user's answer to the prompt, for example, then if the users prompt is invalid it will
handle it as an error instead of the user's input breaking the code, and forcing the code to stop running.
